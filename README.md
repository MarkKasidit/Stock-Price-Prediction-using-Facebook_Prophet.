# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Facebook_Prophet.
This project explores how to predict stock prices using a machine-learning approach.

## Description:

This project predicts stock prices based on historical data pulled from Yahoo!.

## Data:

The data used is a publicly available dataset on stock prices. It includes information on dates and various price attributes.

## Methodology:

**Data Preprocessing**: Prepared the data by pulling from Yahoo! using yfinance API and rearranged columns to fit with the Model.
**Model Building**: Uploaded the model and fit the model with the prepared data
**Model Prediction**: Predicted the stock prices and plot the graphs for visualization

## Results:

The model achieved predicted prices for the specific amount of day. Visualizations like scatter plots helped understand the trend of predicted prices.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the use of the Prophet model for stock price prediction. The model can be further improved by fine-tuning the model.
